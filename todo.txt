DONE -- remove bipolar mode option 
DONE -- stop waveshaping from happening
DONE -- create envelope follower and make the visual indicator respond to it
DONE -- figure out how to add knobs for attack, release, 
DONE ( it was because I used num_samples instead of num_oversamples causing probably a segfault) -- investigate why rapidly changing oversampling rate crashes ardour
DONE -- Hook up attack and release knobs
-- make plugin basic function work
-- Implement smoothing control
-- Put back in a switch for expo/linear
-- Add knob for stereo link
DONE -- Investigate ParamSmooth stuff
-- Investigate ways to implement gain reduction VU meters
-- implement sidechain inputs and add switch for them
